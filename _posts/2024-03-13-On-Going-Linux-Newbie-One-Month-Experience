### Prologue
Hello there! I'm MoonBleu, someone who can google some problems, ask ChatGPT or Gemini if I'm lazy, and that's about it. I don't mind solving things on my own nor am I afraid to ask. Didn't have any problems with my windows install, just curious how Linux is like. There has to be a reason that [Linux adaptation is increasing worldwide](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/06/linux_desktop_share_growing/) right? So on March 13, 2024 I decided to install Linux.
### Installation
I installed [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) on my machine and picked [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com) as my distro of choice as it has the option of dual-booting Windows and Linux so that if there is an app incompatibility I can just boot into Windows. I followed [this guide](https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-mint/) by Abhishek Prakash on [itsfoss.com](itsfoss.com). My USB Drive is 64GB so I chose NTFS for my file system instead of FAT. I backed up all of my files to a hard drive then booted into my laptop's UEFI. I changed the boot order to first check for USB Drives then booted to my USB. Once I was on the live desktop environment, I first checked out if my devices were working before installing, I went through the installed but after choosing the dual-boot option it said I needed to decrypt my BitLocker encrypted drive. I went back into Windows, searched where I can decrypt my drive. After ~20 minutes the decryption was done and I booted back to the USB. All was smooth sailing from here, I just picked the default options then waited as the operating system installs. It prompted me to restart my system and take out the USB drive. Booting back up it showed me the GRUB bootloader where you can choose whether you want to boot into Windows 11 or Linux Mint using the arrow keys and enter key.
